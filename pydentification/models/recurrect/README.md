# Recurrent

Recurrent models package contains a number of standard models using GRU or LSTM cells for dynamical system modelling, 
both simulation and prediction. This package main use is benchmarking.

## Models

* `TimeSeriesGRU` - GRU model for time series prediction
* `TimeSeriesLSTM` - LSTM model for time series prediction
