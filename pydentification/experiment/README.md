# Experiment

This directory contains experiment utils, including entrypoints, which can be used to run W&B experiments. They are not
integral part of the library, so they need additional code defining the experiment settings to run.

## How to Use

To use the entrypoints and utils provided here, `RuntimeContext` needs to be implemented, which is used to parametrize
the experiment. Interface is given by state-less class, so it can be defined as single namespace, it needs to be passed
to the entrypoint function.

To run experiment (assume not using sweep for now), following code needs to be implemented. This additionally allows 
to use `click` library to pass the config files as options.

```python
import click

from pydentification.experiment.entrypoints import run

from src import runtime  # assume this is project specific code


@click.command()
@click.option("--data", type=click.Path(exists=True), required=True)
@click.option("--experiment", type=click.Path(exists=True), required=True)
def main(data, experiment):
    run(data=data, experiment=experiment, runtime=runtime)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run simply execute the script with flags for config passing.

```bash
python main.py --data data.yaml --experiment experiment.yaml
```

## Parametrization

Each training run is parametrized by 5 functions, which take two configurations. Functions are used to define the input,
model architecture, training logic, reporting to W&B and storage logic. For the last three, we provide useful defaults
in `defaults` package. They need to be implemented as part of single namespace, called `context`, which is passed to
entrypoint for running experiment and sweep. Interface for `context` is given by `RuntimeContext`.

Additionally, two config files can be used, one for storing data and one for model parameters. They are used to abstract
dataset loading and creating model architecture from the code, to quickly iterate through different configurations.
Otherwise `pydentification` library can be used as collection of standalone components, which can be useful for various 
project related to neural system identification.

### Functions

* `input_fn` - function which takes configuration file and returns `pl.DataModule` subclass, typically one of data-modules provided by `pydentification`.
* `model_fn` - function which takes configuration file and returns `pl.LightningModule` and `pl.Trainer` instances.
* `train_fn` - function which takes model, trainer and the data-module and executes training code, typically inside the `Trainer`.
* `report_fn` - function, which takes model, trainer and the data-module, it should run predictions and store relevant metrics in W&B dashboard.
* `save_fn` - function takes in run name (given by W&B `id` or `name`) and model, it saves the model to the disk.

### Configurations

The entrypoint (both training and sweep) are parameterized by two configs, one of them is for the data settings and the
other for the experiment and model, which contains hyperparameters and training settings. 

The data config is stored in `YAML` and it is passed to the `input_fn` function. Not all parameters of the data-module
is stored in the data config, only the static values. The example config looks following:

```yaml
name: Dataset
path: data/dataset.csv
test_size: 10000
input_columns: [x]
output_columns: [y]
```

The experiment config looks in the following way.

```yaml
general:
  project: project-name
  n_runs: 1
  name: placeholder
training:
  n_epochs: 10
  patience: 1
  timeout: "00:00:01:00"
  batch_size: 32
  shift: 1
  validation_size: 0.1
model:
  model_name: MLP
  # generic parameter convention
  n_input_time_steps: 64
  n_output_time_steps: 1
  n_input_state_variables: 1
  n_output_state_variables: 1
  # neural network parameters
  n_hidden_layers: 2
  activation: relu
  n_hidden_time_steps: 32
  n_hidden_state_variables: 4
```

To use sweep add following section to the experiment config.

```yaml
sweep:
  name: sweep
  method: random
  metric: {name: test/root_mean_squared_error, goal: minimize}
sweep_parameters:
  # neural network
  n_hidden_layers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  n_hidden_time_steps: [32, 16, 8]
  n_hidden_state_variables: [1, 4, 8, 16]
  activation: [leaky_relu, relu, gelu, sigmoid, tanh]
```

## Resuming

The experiment entrypoint allows runs to be resumed from checkpoints (but not sweeps!). To use the feature
`pl.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` or similar needs to be used to store model and trainer state. Trainer state will contain
all the needed information to resume training, like current epoch, optimizer state and others.

To resume training, `resume` parameter needs to be used passing dict config (ideally YAML can be stored in or JSON file).
It needs to provide W&B resume mode (see: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/runs/resuming), run ID and path to the checkpoint.

The run id will be reused, if `must` resume mode is used, otherwise it can create new W&B run. The weights and optimzier
state will be reused. Note, that the code can be changed between runs, for example to fix the bug. This can introduce 
unwanted behavior. To be sure W&B has a snapshot of the code, it is recommended to use `must` mode.

### Example Config

```yaml
resume_mode: must  # see: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/runs/resuming
run_id: xyz123ab
checkpoint_path: models/xyz123ab/epoch=100-step=10000.ckpt
```

### What to do with sweeps?

To restart sweep, it is best to resume single run (sweeps can create checkpoints as well). Run ID can be easily found
in the W&B dashboard. Single interesting run can be resumed on its own and other runs would need to be restarted in 
whole new sweep.
