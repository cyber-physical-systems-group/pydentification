# Measure

This module contains functionality for measuring the "inner-workings" of neural network system identification models. 
For functionality related to testing models' performance, see the `metrics` module. Current submodules are:
* `eigen` - measure eigenvalues and eigen vectors of matrices in the model
* `parameters` - measure parameter norms for matrices and vectors
* `orthogonality` - measure how close to orthogonal are the transformations inside the identification model
