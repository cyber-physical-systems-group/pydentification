# Examples

This directory contains examples of using the toolbox. The models and training utilities are developed to support 
simulation and prediction experiments, for more details refer to [1]. Additionally, examples for generating benchmarks
using toolbox for chaotic systems [2].

**Table of Contents**
1. `benchmarks` - example of generating benchmark code for prediction experiments
2. `development` - example with using `pydentification` module for development with auto-regression training
3. `prediction` - example with using `pydentification` module for prediction using transformer model and W&B sweep
4. `simulation` - example with using `pydentification` module for simulation with auto-regression training
